# IPv6

On June, 6th 2012, global permanent deployment began for IPv6 by the Internet Society. IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. It carries data in large packets and supports a large number of nodes, more than IPv4 (the version before). The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv4 is a 32 bit numberic address written in decimal as 4 numbers separated by periods while IPv6 is a 128-bit numberic address written in hexadecimal separated by colons.
